0.03% of the cases are fraud - a very skewed dataset. Techniques such as undersampling, oversampling or SMOTE can be used to get better results. Also, the evaluation metric should take into account the skewness of the dataset.

Transaction Dates do not overlap between the train and test dataset. Time based split can be used in cross validation of models.
